                Initially before the start, our team was asked to <strong>find a client</strong>> to conduct the Design
                Evaluation. As a result all the members of my team mailed a lot of companies by offering them to conduct
                the evaluation

            <br>
            <p>For my case, I work at <strong> Blenz Coffee as a Barista</strong>. As a result I asked one of my
                managers if they could get me in contact with the marketing team. After some mails, the Blenz Coffee
                marketing team agreed to help my team out in conducting this evaluation</p>

            <p>This is how I found the client for this very Design Evaluation.

            <p>
                Based on our initial ideas my team had a 5 week process where we tried to evaluate the entire Blenz
                Application by doing certain interview processes and doing many Heuristic Evaluations in order to take
                out
                all the necessary flaws that are there within the app. As a result the following was the 5 week process
                for
                this very assignment .

            <h4>Interview with Blenz
            </h4>
        </div>

        <div class="description4">
            <p>
                So as soon as we came in contact with the Blenz marketing team for the evaluation and scheduled a
                meeting. Before the meeting, our team came up with a <strong> rough Evaluation plan</strong> to present
                our plan for the study to Blenz marketing team and also the questions that we were going to ask.



                So when we conducted the interview I asked them all the questions related to the development of the app.
                They told us about many of the issues they know and also claimed that
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong><i> " Due to COVID-19 we lost a certain amount of business as a result we had to come up with an
                        app in order to compete with rival companies to increase sales"</i></strong>
                <br>




                As a result, their main aim with the future developments was to increase user retention towards the app
                and asked us to suggest the changes they could recommend to the development team.

        </div>


        <div class="description4">
            <p>
                Initially our aim was to find what features tend to enhance the ordering experience of the Blenz App.
                But unfortunately due to my experience as a barista, I observed not many people tend to use the app. If
                I take an average of the entire day, hardly 3-4 people tend to order in advance through the app.

                <br>
                <br>

                Taking this into account, we chose our participants who had <strong> previous experience in using rival
                    companies </strong>like<strong>Tim Hortons and Starbucks</strong> and have them use the app for the
                first time.

                <br><br>

                This allowed the participants to compare the differences within both the apps and tell us how we can
                improve the customer experience with the Blenz Application.

                After our Interviews and finalizing the participants, we initially gave them a questionnaire that was
                based on the Starbucks app so that we can find what things people like on the other apps.

        <div class="description4">
            <p>
                After the Starbucks Interviews, our team conducted heuristic evaluations on the app. These evaluations
                are done by a group of designers that tend to analyze the app deeply and then pile up their findings
                based on Nielsen's 10 Heuristics for User Interface. I also had some major findings while conducting
                these which are down below:

                <br>
                <br>

            <p>
                For the order now they use the acronym ASAP rather than use a simpler and more understood “order now”
                <br>
                This is because some people might not know the meaning of ASAP which means "As soon as Possible".
                <br>
                Because of this maybe they should look for some other wording to represent the same meaning

            <h4>Consistency and Standards</h4>
            <p>
                When I was trying to place orders through the order now, I saw a map icon(the part in red box on the top
                right) which led me to the same process of ordering. This can make the user getting confused and lost in
                terms of which place to order.

                <br><br>
                As a result my recommendation here would be to have a single ordering button so that the users don't get
                confused in terms of which place to order

            <p>
                After all these heuristic evaluations that me and my group did, we got a clear idea regarding the
                problems faced within the app. To research more and get more in depth issues within the app we had to
                conduct one of the Usability Studies for this. As a result my group chose Cued Recall Debrief Method for
                this.
                <br><br>
                To explain this method, first the person's screen is being recorded based on what the user is doing in
                order to get an idea regarding how one navigates through an interface and then interview them regarding
                how they felt for the steps that are important for the development of the interface.

                <br><br>

                Based on this it allowed us to get a clear idea regarding how the participant were using the app and
                then interview them later on to get a clear response regarding how one feels regarding the app usage.

                After all this, I started the experiment by explaining the participant that they are going to be given a
                set of tasks that were to be done for the experiment and as an incentive, they will get a coffee and a
                muffin as a reward for completing this study. These are the following tasks:-
            </p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 5%">
                <li>Find the nearest Blenz location</li>
                <li>Order a medium sized Americano</li>
                <li>Add a food item to the cart

                </li>
                <li>Claim 1000 points for the Americano</li>
                <li>Pay for the food item</li>
                <li>Set up a pick-up time</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>These tasks helped us to go through the entire app and evaluate all the necessary things that are needed
                to be done while ordering. For example, we evaluated how easy/ difficult is to find the nearest location
                of blenz, then what steps are being taken by the user to find their desired drink, are all the
                modifications given enough or is their something that can be improved on them , how easy is it to claim
                points and lastly how smoothly does the app goes on.


                <br><br>
                For evaluation purposes, we screen recorded how the person is actually ordering and for some of the
                participants we also recorded themselves while ordering their items which helped us in gaining proper
                insight in how they are feeling and getting necessary data regarding their emotions towards the app

                After the initial activity of completing the tasks were done, I asked the participants to watch the video we had just recorded of them using the application. This part of the activity was also recorded, which will pertain to the later data analysis and gathering. I asked the participants to comment and mentioned anything they were thinking at that current time.
                <br><br>
                Our team mainly looked for any positive, neutral and negative comments they would make about the application and their experience. During this activity, we tried to encourage participants to expand on issues that they thought of when using the application, as well as to vocalize any thought processes. Ensuring comfortability and participant freedom will provide authenticity of the participant's emotional feedback. 
                <br><br>
                After all this was done, I coded all the negative, positive or neutral comments the participants made and based on that me and my team combined all our findings to come to conclusion and take out the key findings from these study and then calculate the IRR(Inter Rated Reliability).

            <h4>Inter Rater Reliability (IRR)</h4>

                After all our studies were conducted and comment coded, . a second designer would also do the same for another designer’s cued-debrief recall. After the second designer finished the evaluation of the comments, a IRR calculation would be done to compare the 2 results. The goal is to ensure an above 0.9 correlation for reliability. If the IRR correlation came to below 0.9, both designers that conducted the evaluation would come to agreement and understanding of how each designer categorized each comment. Designers will re-code until the IRR correlation hits a 0.9 correlation and above.  This helped us in ensuring that our study is reliable
                <br><br>
                My team had 9 pairs of Inter-rater reliability tests out of which 2 of them were done by me, and the results are as followed: Set A - 0.92, Set B - 1.0, Set C - 0.98, Set D - 0.99, Set E - 0.97, Set F - 0.98, Set G - 0.95, Set H - 0.92 and Set I - 0.94. The average correlation from these results was 0.96. To interpret these results, we can say that these numbers are very reliable because the closer to 1.0 the correlation is the more accurate the result is. We also tallied the number of positive, neutral, and negative comments. We had 98 positive comments, 94 neutral comments and 184 negative comments. Based on the calculations that we did for these comments, it suggests that our study was reliable.

                From the results I found from the CDR, we found that users complained seeing two different styles of maps, too much selection choice in the customization page and unclear of how to redeem food/drink items with points.
                <br><br>
                Navigation of the ordering process was forked, leading to users being lost when encountering a problem. A lack of error prevention also contributed to the forking and confusion.
                <br><br>
                Icon placements were unintuitive which led to users having to rely on the wording, rather than intuitiveness and cognition. An outdated interface had warranted an unattractive response from users, which could result in a large negative bias towards the entirety of the app.

        <div class="description4">
            <p>
                Based on all the research me and my team did, we recommend utilizing prototypes and conducting user-testing with different mockups. Field studies may provide valuable insights for the designers, due to the nature of the test being real-world applicable, however this may come at a larger financial cost.
                <br><br>
                A food/drink ordering application such as Blenz may take place in very fast-paced environments, and conducting user-tests with a time-variable may be worth the extra cost for valuable data. With regards to the visual/interface design, our design team recommends removing unnecessary elements. Prioritize on providing information that is important and necessary, whilst reducing and subordinating information that are not as relevant or important but still vital.
                <br><br>
                Consider the visual clustering of features and information for readability purposes. Meaning, use of white space and font selection/sizes can significantly impact the user’s interaction with something minor such as a micro feature. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                To add on this I would also recommend in taking care of the navigation of the interface and also have consistency because it is important that the user gets his task of ordering done in a smooth manner.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Also to add a location tracker to the "Find my nearest Blenz" because based on my personal experience of working at the store myself and also during one of my studies, customers sometimes tend to order the drink on the wrong location and as a result are unable to enjoy their coffee. This leads to frustration and is a major issue to be dealt with.
                
                <br><br>
                
                Me and one of my teammate also worked on a prototype as a recommendation to the Blenz Marketing team which could help in creation of a clear and aesthetic design.

            Overall, this project was a great experience regarding learning Design Evaluations and how one works in a team while doing a rigrous evaluation towards the app. This project was also a great practical use of the skills on a potential real client and how one has to communicate and work according to the client needs while keeping in mind of certain deadlines with it. This also helped me in enriching my prototyping skills along with developing certain contacts and communication skills because I was the one who had the constant communication with the client
