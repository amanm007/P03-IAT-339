        <h2 class="game-description-title">What is Slow and Steady?</h2>
        <p class="game-description-text">Slow and Steady was created for senior level game development course, IAT 410, at SFU. The project brief was to create an engaging 2D game from the scratch. Our team chose to make a 2D shooting horde based game as it was the genre that excited every team member.</p>

            <p class="game-description-text">Our goal was to create an engaging horde-based 2D shooting game with 
                interesting gameplay mechanics. Key features include interesting shooting mechanics,
                 challenging enemy types, and progressive waves of enemies. Player strategy
                  and skill progression are central to the game's design, 
                  providing a satisfying and replayable gaming experience.
                  We aimed for a game that would not only captivate but also offer depth
                   and variety in its play styles.</p>

        <h2 class="game-description-title">Summary of Contributions</h2>
        <p class="game-description-text"> <strong>Core Gameplay Mechanics and Responsive Design: </strong>
            The initial development weeks saw a strong focus on foundational mechanics. I spearheaded the creation of a responsive 
            control system, enabling fluid player movement through intuitive WASD and arrow key integration. 
            The precision aiming system was particularly pivotal, as it aligned player character aiming with 
            the mouse cursor for accurate, directional shooting. This served to deepen player engagement and
             elevate the interactive experience of "Slow and Steady."</p>

             <p class="game-description-text"> <strong>Enhanced Shooting Dynamics:</strong>
                To bolster the shooting mechanics, I integrated immediate hit feedback through bullet physics 
                and collision detection, ensuring every shot delivered a satisfying experience for the player. 
                This was further amplified by the addition of bullet tracing effects, enhancing both the game's
                 visual appeal and the shooting experience.</p>

                 <p class="game-description-text"> <strong>Health Systems and Progressive Challenges:</strong>
                    As the game's depth expanded, I developed a versatile enemy health system that accommodated varying enemy types and
                     introduced a wave spawner system. This not only diversified combat but also structured the 
                     encounters, escalating the difficulty and requiring strategic survival tactics from the player.</p>


                <p class="game-description-text"> <strong> Enemy Advanced AI and Tactical Depth:</strong>
                    Later weeks saw the introduction of new enemy AI types with unique behaviors, adding to the tactical depth of
                     the game. The implementation of a reload bar as a visual cue for the shooting cooldown added 
                     strategic pacing to combat scenarios.</p>

        <p class="game-description-text"> In the creation of "Slow and Steady," our development journey focused on delivering an immersive and strategic gameplay experience. Early stages involved laying foundational mechanics such as responsive player movement and precise aiming systems. As development progressed, we refined enemy AI, introducing complex behaviors and intelligent pathfinding to enhance the interactive challenges. We also implemented a robust health system and dynamic enemy encounters to keep the gameplay engaging. Key advancements included the integration of visual and shooting mechanics that provide immediate feedback and intensify the action. Our final efforts concentrated on optimizing performance through projectile pooling and designing a compelling boss battle with the "Cybertruck," featuring a multi-stage fight that tests player adaptability. Collaborative efforts from every team member, especially in areas like pixel art and UI programming, were crucial in bringing the intricate details of our game to life, making "Slow and Steady" a game that challenges the mind and excites the senses.</p>

    <div class="reflection">
        <h2 class="game-description-title">Reflection</h2>
        <p class="game-description-text"> Developing "Slow and Steady" has been a profoundly rewarding experience that pushed the boundaries of our creativity and technical skills.
             Throughout the development process, we tackled various challenges, from fine-tuning the fluidit
             y of player movements to enhancing the complexity of enemy AI for more engaging combat scenarios.
              Significant achievements included the implementation of a versatile enemy health system and a
               strategic wave spawner that heightened the game's challenge and replay value.
                Our focus on visual feedback and dynamic shooting mechanics also played a crucial role in elevating the player's immersive experience.
                Reflecting on this journey, the collaboration and relentless dedication of our team were instrumental in transforming our initial concepts into a thrilling and 
                cohesive gaming experience that we hope will resonate deeply with players.</p>
