            <p class="game-description-text">Storge is a 2D pixel survival horror game in which the player takes on the role of
                June, a detective who must uncover the truth of the mysterious disappearances of her
                old orphanage. Taking inspiration from games such as Ib, the game involves exploration,
                simple puzzles, and avoiding enemies. The game mainly takes place in the Veil, which is
                an alternate nightmarish realm within the orphanage. </p>

                 <p class="game-description-text"> <strong>The Beast/Antagonist/Enemy :</strong>
                    Engineered a sophisticated AI system allowing The Beast to patrol using predefined waypoints, with dynamic obstacle avoidance and pathfinding.
                    Integrated sensors for player detection triggering behavior changes from patrolling to chasing, enhancing the game’s challenge.
                    Configured the enemy to inflict damage upon contact, with a continuous damage system when the player remains in proximity, intensifying survival strategies.
                    Incorporated methods for controlling sound effect pitch and volume, allowing for immersive audio experiences.


                </p>


                <p class="game-description-text"> <strong> Sound Effects: </strong>
                    Implemented varied footstep sound effects and synchronized damage sounds with player-enemy interactions, enhancing auditory feedback.
                    Added rich background music and state-specific sounds for The Beast, contributing to an immersive audio landscape.

        <p class="game-description-text"> After adapting the script, our team set out to design the characters and game
            world. We settled on using a 32x32 size for our pixel art, as it is a size that allows for
            both simplicity and detail depending on what is being drawn. Characters were designed
            using concept art drawn for the original script, and then reimagined in pixel form. This
            involved simplifying some of the original details as well as creating a dedicated colour
            pallet for each of the characters. This also gave us the opportunity to make sure that the
            characters matched the setting’s identified time period: the 80’s. Most of the character
            designs remained similar to the original concept images, however changes were made
            to the Beast and new concepts were made for supporting characters to fit the new script
            while keeping the established world of a small North American town in the 80’s. We also
            took the opportunity to add symbolic elements to the character designs (such as flowers
            with symbolic meanings) to further tie them into the story.</p>

        <h2 class="game-description-title">Reflection</h2>
        <p class="game-description-text"> In the course of developing "The Storge", I embarked on a journey
            that not only expanded my technical skills but also deepened my
            understanding of game development as a whole. This immersive experience
            allowed me to grasp the intricacies of player interaction, sound design, and
            health management within a game. The implementation of player
            movement, complete with animations and footsteps, brought life to my
            virtual world, offering players a responsive and engaging gameplay
            experience.This project has not only honed my Unity skills but also
            deepened my passion for game development. It has been a remarkable
            journey of creativity, problem-solving, and continuous learning, leaving me
            eager to explore and create even more captivating game experiences in the
            future.</p>
